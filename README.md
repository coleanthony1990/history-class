## About The Project

History Class is an application giving the user the ability to learn short history snippets about a subject of the user's choosing. Users can save the snippets in a collection for referencing later.

## Project Spec
History Class is an application built in week 18 of the [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.edu/) front-end engineering program. The goals of this [project](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/showcase.html) were to:

* Create a robust testing suite using Cypress
* Generate and display user data through data manipulation using React
* Make network requests to API endpoints to retrieve and manipulate data
* Implement error handling 
* Implement third party packages

## Reflections
I really like the idea of useful apps that can be used quickly in the moment. Like someone who might use [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/) on their phone, this app would give the user quick necessary information. I feel as though I completed that task. The challenges I faced were mostly around getting familiar with the technologies. For instance, I found that I was not able to us a <Link> from React Router on a single element in a form but I had to use it on the whole form. Therefor I learned how to use the "useHistory" hook instead.
